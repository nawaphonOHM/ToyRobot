# How to run:

`./gradlew run --console=plain` or `gradlew run`

And then wait for gradle sets up its stuff and if it finishes It should show **"Welcome to the Toy Robot!"** on your terminal, that is, you can start testing from now on.

I also write some unit tests that you can run with `./gradlew test`.
